# SatSenseAI
This project uses satellite imagery and Artificial Intelligence to predict socio-economic indicators. It explores scalable, cost-effective alternatives to traditional surveys, aiming to uncover patterns for smarter decision-making.

# 🌍 SatSenseAI – Predicting Socioeconomic Indicators from Satellite Imagery

## Overview

**SatSenseAI** is a machine learning project that leverages night-time satellite imagery to predict socio-economic (SE) indicators. By combining geospatial data with AI, this project aims to provide scalable, real-time, and cost-effective alternatives to traditional survey-based methods.

## 🔍 Motivation

Understanding SE conditions is crucial for effective policy-making and resource allocation. However, traditional data collection (e.g., censuses, surveys) can be time-consuming, expensive, and outdated—especially in low-resource or underrepresented regions. Satellite imagery, especially night-time lights, offers a powerful proxy to estimate economic activity and human development at scale.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict SE indicators using (night-time) satellite images.
- Explore and engineer new features from satellite data.
- Build models that generalize across diverse geographic areas.
- Discover novel use cases for satellite-based SE analysis.

## 🛰️ Data Sources

- **VIIRS Night-Time Lights (NASA/NOAA)**
- **Landsat & Sentinel imagery (Google Earth Engine)**
- Additional geospatial datasets as needed

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworkds

- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- Google Earth Engine (GEE)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, GeoPandas
- Jupyter/Colab Notebooks
